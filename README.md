# Text-to-Image-Generation-using-GAN
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for generating synthetic images from textual descriptions using StackGAN. It focuses on converting fine-grained text embeddings (e.g., bird descriptions) into photo-realistic images, useful for data augmentation and generative AI research.
Gan-Model Training for the conversion of text to image using the Gan model and running mutiple epochs  to reducing the loss parameters and Increasing the accuracy of the images generated using the dataset.
